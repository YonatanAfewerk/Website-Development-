1. Whats is the internet infrastructure?
    The internet is a network of cables that facilitates the transmission of "Data Packets"

2. What are Data packets?
    contains the information being transmitted over the network. They also contain information 
    about the sender and recipient.

            Eg.
                    Data Packet
                
                Header:
                    Senders ip
                    receivers ip
                    protocol
                    packet number
                Payload:
                    Data
                Trailer:
                    Data to show end of packet
                    Error correction

3. Ip Address
    Is a string of numbers separated by periods they define the address of the device.
4. Bandwidth 
    Is the speed ata which data packets can be transmitted and its measured by "Bitrate".
        Bitrate - number bits per second a network can transmit.
        Latency - Amount of time it takes for 1 bit to be sent from the sender to the receiver
5. Protocol
    IP (internet protocol) - route info to the proper address
    TCP protocol - Facilitates the transmission of data packets Ensure that no information is missing 
    HTTP protocol 
    HTTPS protocol - More secure than HTTP
                        - Data packets are encrypted using SSL(secure socket layer) or TLS(transport security layer)
    SMTP protocol - Simple mail transfer protocol
                    Two types of mail delivery
                        Local domain
                        outbound domain
6. Web Server 
    A computer that hosts a website or web applications.
        Configured to accept remote connections with internet users and relay data through HTTP/HTTPS

7. Security Certificate
    Requires installation on the web server and can be purchased from a reputable vendor 
    (EV[Extended validation] certificates offer the highest level of security) 



NOTE: Network basics - LAN and WAN

    LAN (Local Area Network)
        A group of computers that share a common communication line within a relatively small area.
        typically confined to a single room, building or group of buildings 
    WAN (Wide Area Network)
        A more complex network that spans across much larger geographical areas such as cities, states and nations.
        The internet is the largest WAN in existence

    Network Ports
        This is like a data pipe line that can Configured on your router based different protocols.
    
    Firewalls
        Is a system designed to prevent unauthorized access to or from the network.
                Hardware -> on the routers 
                Software -> on the Development
